			 <h1 id="week-1-the-start">Week 1: The start</h1>
<p>Finally, a simple and elegant solution to my blogging anxieties: weeknotes! Instead of spamming people&rsquo;s feeds with short updates on movies and dinners, I&rsquo;ll collect everything into a weekly post. I still get my little corner on the internet to yell at the void, while keeping my own timeline cleaner.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I started following a Mediterranean Diet. I&rsquo;d like to lose some weight, but my biggest motivation is to eat healthier and try different foods. So far, I&rsquo;m loving it! This week I made greek salad, spanakopita and tabbouleh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A heat-wave hit Valencia again this week. Absolutely hellish. Survival plan: swimming pool, a game of Ticket to Ride and cold beer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My <strong>dad</strong> and his fianc√© traveled to Valencia to visit us! It was an absolutely AMAZING and ultra intense for an introvert like me. Many laughs, hugs and moments to cherish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We booked a table at  <a href="https://www.habitual.es">Restaurant Habitual</a> by chef Ricard Camarena. Delicious food and probably the most affordable Michelin-recommended restaurant I&rsquo;ve ever been to. I&rsquo;ll be back many times!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also went to <a href="https://bodegavalencians.com">Bodega Valencians</a>, a family-owned restaurant in the middle of the old town. Delicious and very traditional food, stuff you just don&rsquo;t find anymore nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9253284/">Andor Season 2</a> last week. Unpopular opinion, but I found it just &ldquo;meh&rdquo;. A well-made and boring space-opera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçø Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3748528/">Rogue One</a> again, after finishing Andor. Loved following the story arc and the characters. Rogue One flows seamlessly from Andor to New Hope. Great writing, cinematography, a touch of humor&hellip; I think this might be <em><strong>*&ldquo;the&rdquo;*</strong></em> best Star Wars movie, ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçø Watched <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt5950044/">Superman (2025)</a> in the cinemas! A solid and entertaining movie, good story, good action. I liked seeing the &ldquo;human&rdquo; side of Clark, his dating life, his ego, him worried about Krypto the Superdog&hellip; It was fun to watch and exactly what I expect from a super hero movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçø Finally watched <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt1677720/">Ready Player One</a> &ndash; was convinced for years it was an alternative name to <em>Rogue One</em>&hellip; oh well. I liked the back and forth between true reality and virtual reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes">Alice&rsquo;s Weaknotes</a>, absolutely hilarious at times. Her very <a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-1">first weaknote</a> is a must-read.</li>
<li><a href="https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/">Rowan&rsquo;s Weeknotes</a> are also really fun to read. Love all the <a href="https://rowanmanning.com/tags/kittens/">cat</a> updates.</li>
<li><a href="https://barryfrost.com/articles">Barry&rsquo;s Articles</a> make me feel like I know him. The kind of mundane things I want to write about.</li>
<li>Apart from the mundane updates I love, <a href="https://www.curnow.org/archive/weeknotes/">Hello Curns' Weeknotes</a> feature at least one image each week. As a former pro-photographer (and now a very lazy hobbist), I am excited to use my own weeknotes as an excuse to photograph more.</li>
<li>I laughed so hard at this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ylkyrkjnzo">video of robots playing a football</a> tournament! ü§ñ The best thing I&rsquo;ve seen in ages!</li>

			 <p>A month ago I went to Andaluc√≠a. It was amazing,  I visited castles,  went to two fancy restaurants, took a million photos telling myself I would make an online gallery,  maybe even print and frame a few&hellip; and I still haven&rsquo;t downloaded, edited or even looked at the images. It&rsquo;s a struggle! üì∑üó∫</p>

			 <h2 id="one-blog-to-rule-them-all">One blog to rule them all</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve been blogging on and off since the early 2000‚Äôs. I‚Äôve blogged about linux, going to university, movies, programming, photography, moving to Rio de Janeiro, moving to Sweden, moving to Spain, gardening, traveling, learning to play the piano, learning to sew, learning esperanto‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Sadly, none of those blogs are alive today and I think the main reason is I was misguided by the idea that ‚Äúyou need a niche‚Äù. I tried to put all the things I enjoyed in my life into tiny individual boxes. For each box, a blog. As one of those persons who is into <em>everything</em>, I am never excited about anything long enough to keep writing about it forever.</p>
<p>Now I realised I don‚Äôt want to commit to one topic for the rest of my life. I want to have a truly personal blog that reflects my <em>person</em>. Maybe today I‚Äôm really into baking sourdough bread. Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôm really into wind-surfing. Who knows. I don‚Äôt need to create a wind surfing blog to tell the world how much I love it.</p>
<p>Everything bundled together, just like in real life. This will be the <em>One Blog to Rule Them All</em>.</p>

<p>This weekend we went to the xmas market at Ciutat de les Arts i Ci√®ncias. I&rsquo;ve been there many times before, but I hadn&rsquo;t seen it during sunset and blue hour. The colors, the reflections, the shapes, it was so inspiring! üì∑</p>

			 <p>Yesterday we celebrated exactly 15 days since Luna joined our family. Welcoming a second dog has been at the same time joy and challenge. üê∂</p>
<p>Here are three things I (re) learned about dogs in those past 2 weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rising early and having a routine is essential. With the years, our routine with Astro has relaxed and he&rsquo;s quite flexible. We could get up late during weekends. Not anymore! I&rsquo;ve been rising early every day and really keeping the dogs in a bathroom-food-training schedule to help Luna adapt.</li>
<li>Clicker training is wonderful! It&rsquo;s been years since I used a clicker with Astro. Now I&rsquo;m using it to teach Luna and she LOVES it! She&rsquo;s really smart and motivated.</li>
<li>Having a new dog is like having an <strong>alien</strong> at home. It took me a long time to understand Astro and make myself understood. He was my first dog after a lifetime with cats and it honestly took me almost two years, with help from courses, books and lots of patience. Little by little I&rsquo;m learning to read Luna&rsquo;s body language and her expressions. She&rsquo;s more shy than Astro, she doesn&rsquo;t move her eyebrows or her tail so much, but her ears say a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been days where I felt overwhelmed, thinking &ldquo;wtf have I done?!&rdquo;, but most of the days have been really fun! Thank you Luna for bringing all those emotions and memories back into my life.</p>

			 <p>Day 3 of Luna. She&rsquo;s crazy about food. Today she tried to steal a wooden spoon from the sink with rests of omelette on it. The spoon fell with a noise and I caught her in the act. She then pretended she was not at all interested and waltzed out of the kitchen. She also dances near garbage cans and <em>licks her lips</em> when she sees a cat. üê∂</p>

			 <h2 id="astro">Astro</h2>
<p>Astro came into my life in 2013, when I lived in Sweden. I didn&rsquo;t have friends, barely went out (only for groceries), got a major vitamin D deficiency, life sucked. I considered getting a cat, then realized I&rsquo;d spend the rest of my life on the couch hugging the cat. A friend then told me how her golden retriever basically saved her from depression and how fun it was and how cute a golden puppy is and that was it. I decided I was going to ger my first dog!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sweden is a great place to be a dog. Pups are welcome on the bus, on the subway, on boats, at bars, parks‚Ä¶ We took Astro everywhere we went. The dog really had a great life rolling in the snow, exploring nature, mountains, beaches, lakes, and chasing ducks (until the day some swans chased us! It was awful!).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2016, my husband and I decided we were tired of the Swedish weather (= 2 months of summer, 10 months of darkness and snow?! NOPE! I&rsquo;m from Brazil, I need my sunlight!). So we packed our car, traveled 3000km south, and moved to Spain. The humans in the family were in extasy, the canine in the family not so much&hellip; His favorite thing in life was rolling in the snow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Astro was supposed to be the one and only, until another friend implanted in my head the idea of adopting a Spanish greyhound. It didn&rsquo;t take much to convince me&hellip; All she had to do was tell me about galgos in Spain, how they&rsquo;re mistreated and abused. I impulsively started writing to every galgo shelter I found online and in less than a week, I had found Luna. So this is the situation. She is currently being transported from Andaluc√≠a to Valencia and I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking, but it is what it is, I guess. Now I have a second dog.</p>

<p>Even though we didn&rsquo;t stay long there, we fell in love with the local people and the city&rsquo;s relaxed, easy going vibes. It was winter back then, so the next summer we came back to check the beach and yep, it was as amazing as we thought it would be! ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>Last, but not least: Ryanair cancelled our flight back home, the island was crowded and they couldn&rsquo;t find any cheap accomodation near the airport, so we were <em>forced</em> to overnight at this incredible luxury hotel with a view to the sea, and had and amazing dinner including a bottle of wine, all expenses paid by RyanAir!

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that the Swedish summer &ldquo;can&rdquo; be warm and nice, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it usually is. Most years are cold. There is always ONE week in July that&rsquo;s quite perfect. Every five years we get a decent heat wave that lasts a full two months. That&rsquo;s it. The mythic Swedish summer in a nutshell.

			 <p>Loved visiting the medieval pueblo of Montblanc yesterday. So incredibly charming. Locals believe the famous fight between Saint George and the Dragon actually took place in the mountains surrounding the pueblo &ndash; and absolutely NOT in Cappadocia, as we have all been wrongly led to believe. Beautiful red roses grew where the dragon blood was spilled, and this is why Catalans gift roses to each other on the day of Sant Jordi. So now you know it too.</p>
